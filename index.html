            <h1> The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes </h1>
            <div class="story-body">
                <p>"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"</p>

                <p>I held the little printed slip to the light.</p>

                <p>"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"</p>

                <p>"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."</p>

                <p>"They are typewritten," I remarked.</p>

                <p>"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."</p>

                <p>"Of what?"</p>

                <p>"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"</p>

                <p>"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."</p>

                <p>"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."</p>

                <p>I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.</p>

                <p>I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.</p>

                <p>A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.</p>

                <p>"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.</p>

                <p>"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."</p>

                <p>"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.</p>

                <p>"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."</p>

                <p>"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"</p>

                <p>The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.</p>

                <p>This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!</p>

                <p>The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.</p>

                <p>"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"</p>

                <p>"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"</p>

                <h1> Variable Fonts</h1>
                <p> When a graphic designer prepares their work, they typically export the final artwork in a way that either embeds all of the fonts used, or they provide an export archive that contains all of the assets used separately, a bit like a basic website. The cost to the designer depends on the suitability of the typeface for the rendering context (is it legible at small sizes, for example) and the license to use the fonts.On the web, we have to consider both aspects, plus the associated bandwidth costs. For every member of a typeface family used in our designs, we have had to require another font file to be downloaded by our users before they can see that text. Only including the Regular and Bold styles, plus their italic counterparts, can amount to 500k or more of data. This has been a sticking point for web designers and developers, as a richer typographic experience comes at a cost. This is even before we have dealt how the fonts are rendered, and the fallback or delayed-loading patterns we are going to use (such as "FOIT" and "FOUT").) A variable font is a collection of master styles, with one central 'default' master (usually the Regular font style) and multiple registered “axes” which tie the central master to the other masters. For example, the Weight axis might connect a Light style master to the default style and through to the Bold style master. The individual styles that can be located along this axis are called instances.</p>

                <p>The way that Italics are handled in variable fonts is interesting, as there are two difference approaches. Typefaces like Helvetica or Roboto have interpolation compatible contours, so their Roman and Italic styles can be interpolated between and the Slant axis can be used to get from Roman to Italic. Other typefaces (such as Garamond, Baskerville, or Bodoni) have Roman and Italic glyph contours that are not interpolation compatible. For example, the contours that typically define a Roman lowercase “n” do not match the contours used to define an Italic lowercase “n”. Instead of interpolating one contour to the other, the Italic axis toggles from Roman to Italic contours.</p>

                <p>Since the font developers define which axes are available in their fonts, it is essential to check the font's documentation to know what is available. For example, in the Gingham variable font designed by Christoph Koeberlin, there are two axes available, Width and Weight. The Amstelvar variable font does not contain a Slant axis, but does have an axis it calls Grade, plus many more axes. A Grade axis is interesting as it changes the weight of the font without changing the widths, so line breaks does not change. By playing with a Grade axis, you can avoid being forced to fiddle with changes to Weight axis that effects the overall width, and then changes to the Width axis that effect the overall weight. This is possible because the Amstelvar default style has been deconstructed in the 4 fundamental aspects of form: black or positive shapes, white or negative shapes, and the x and y dimensions. These 4 aspects can be mixed to form the other styles, such as Width and Weight, in the way that primary colors can be mixed to create any other color.</p>
